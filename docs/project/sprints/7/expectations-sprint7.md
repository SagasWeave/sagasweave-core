# Sprint 7 Expectations: Backend, CI/CD & Deployment

## Objective

The primary goal of this sprint is to build and deploy the backend infrastructure, automate the entire development lifecycle with CI/CD, and ensure the SagasWeave application is production-ready. By the end of this sprint, we will have a fully functional, deployed, and auto-updating application.

## Verification Checklist

To consider this sprint successful, the following conditions must be met:

### 1. Cloudflare Worker Backend
-   [ ] A Hono-based application is running on Cloudflare Workers.
-   [ ] The `wrangler.toml` file is correctly configured for `dev`, `test`, and `production` environments.
-   [ ] API endpoints for core functionalities are implemented and tested.
-   [ ] Logging and error handling are implemented in the worker.

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
-   [ ] A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) is created and functional.
-   [ ] The workflow automatically triggers on every push to the `main` branch.
-   [ ] The workflow successfully installs dependencies, builds the frontend and backend, and runs all tests.
-   [ ] The workflow automatically deploys the application to Cloudflare upon successful completion of all previous steps.
-   [ ] The CI/CD pipeline fails if any build or test step fails, preventing a broken deployment.

### 3. Deployment and Testing
-   [ ] The application is successfully deployed and accessible at a public URL.
-   [ ] End-to-end tests that cover the integration between the frontend and the new backend pass successfully.
-   [ ] The deployed application is stable, performant, and free of critical bugs.

### 4. Documentation
-   [ ] All new backend code is documented.
-   [ ] The CI/CD process is documented for future reference.

## Outcome

Upon successful completion of this sprint, we will have a production-grade PWA with a robust serverless backend and a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. This setup will enable rapid and reliable development cycles, ensuring that new features and fixes can be delivered to users efficiently and safely.
