# Sprint 1 Expectations: Core Setup & Dashboard Shell

## Objective

The primary goal of this sprint is to establish the project's skeleton. This includes setting up the monorepo, initializing the frontend and backend applications, and creating a basic, runnable PWA shell. This sprint is foundational and does not include any dynamic functionality.

---

## Verification Checklist

To consider this sprint successful, the following conditions must be met:

### 1. Project Structure
-   [x] A monorepo structure exists as defined in `projectstructuredefinition.md`.
-   [x] A root `package.json` is configured with workspaces for `apps/frontend` and `apps/backend`.

### 2. Frontend Application (PWA Shell)
-   [x] The frontend app is created with Vite, React, and TypeScript.
-   [x] Material-UI (MUI) is installed and a basic theme provider is set up.
-   [x] The application runs without errors using an `npm run dev` script.
-   [x] A basic `AppBar` and a content area are visible in the browser.
-   [x] The app has a valid `manifest.json` and a basic service worker, making it installable as a PWA.

### 3. Backend Application (Server Shell)
-   [x] The backend app is created with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.
-   [x] The server runs without errors using an `npm run dev` script.
-   [x] A single health-check endpoint (e.g., `/api/health`) is implemented and returns a `200 OK` status.

## Outcome

Upon successful completion, we will have a solid foundation for the project. The development environment will be fully configured, and we will have a deployable, non-functional PWA shell. This allows subsequent sprints to focus on building features rather than on setup and configuration.
