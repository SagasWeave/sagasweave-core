# Sprint 2 Expectations: Dashboard Core Functionality

## Objective

The goal of this sprint is to bring the dashboard to life by implementing its core features: creating, viewing, and deleting projects. The data will be stored locally in the browser, making the application stateful and interactive from the user's perspective.

---

## Verification Checklist

To consider this sprint successful, the following conditions must be met:

### 1. Project Creation
-   [ ] There is a visible input field and a button for adding new projects.
-   [ ] Clicking the 'Add' button with a valid project name adds a new item to the project list UI.
-   [ ] The input field is cleared after a project is successfully added.

### 2. Project List Display
-   [ ] All created projects are displayed in a clear, scrollable list.
-   [ ] Each item in the list displays the project's title.
-   [ ] A message is displayed if the project list is empty (e.g., "No projects yet. Create one!").

### 3. Project Deletion
-   [ ] Each project item in the list has a 'Delete' button.
-   [ ] Clicking the 'Delete' button removes the corresponding project from the list UI.

### 4. Data Persistence
-   [ ] After adding or deleting projects, if the user reloads the browser window, the list of projects remains the same.
-   [ ] The application correctly loads the initial project list from `localStorage` on startup.

## Outcome

Upon successful completion of this sprint, we will have a functional dashboard prototype. Users will be able to manage a simple list of projects, and their work will be saved across sessions in the same browser. This provides the first piece of tangible value to the end-user.
