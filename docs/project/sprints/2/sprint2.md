# Sprint 2: Dashboard Core Functionality

## Goal

To implement the primary user interactions within the Dashboard, allowing users to manage their projects.

## Method

Develop the UI components for creating, listing, and deleting projects. Implement client-side state management to handle the project list. At this stage, projects are simple data structures stored locally (e.g., in `localStorage` or a simple in-memory store) without a persistent backend.

## Outcome

A functional dashboard where users can create new projects, see them listed in the UI, and remove them. This makes the dashboard a usable, albeit simple, project hub.
